</p>

The idea is to setup android project with essential architecture and basic libs to start app development. It's in-line with the latest libs and tools for android development.

Todo app demonstrates to have basic components to ease app development. It should provide you component that are not 
available in android studio default template plugin.

I'd want to explore things that can keep app development in parallel and reduce usual development time.

Feel free to raise your feedback/queries 

A simple production ready(i.e NotesyApp) android app template that lets you create and upload APK to play store.

The idea is to setup and deliver app in just few steps.
